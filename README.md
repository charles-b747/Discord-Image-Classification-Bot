This project contains the code to a Discord bot that can recognize edible and non-edible mushrooms 🍄🍄‍🟫 on a picture🖼️, which is sent by the user 🙋🏼‍♀️ on the Discord chat. After that it's analyzed by the bot's integrated AI 🤖 and the results are sent back to the user with an easy to understand language 😜.

The original version of the bot was developed in Visual Studio Code for Windows 🪟. If you were to have any questions about this repository or it's content, please let me know!

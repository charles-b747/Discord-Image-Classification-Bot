This project contains the code to a Discord bot that can recognize edible and non-edible mushrooms on a picture, which is sent by the user on the Discord chat. After that it's 
analyzed by the bot's integrated AI and the results are sent back to the user with an easy to understand language.

The original version of the bot was developed in Visual Studio Code for Windows. If you were to have any questions about this repository or it's content, please let me know!
